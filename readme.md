1. Assuming that intelligent life exists, do you believe they would make contact with the human race? 
\n Probably not.
Mike: The chances of making contact in the vastness of the universe are minute, but the possibility of technologies that are beyond our understanding of the universe allow for the possibility to be greater than we assume. Whether they would want to or not, probably not, because to them we woud probably be as ants intelectually speaking. 

Fiona: Given the SENS initiative and Aubrey de Grey's research -- If we were able to extend the human life by 500 years, there would be more opportunity for indepth research. Research and deployment of genetic advancements of the human body and exploration of inorganic intelligence **_will lead to_** exploring space outside our solar system with ease. Chances are, we will cover more 'ground' and possibly uncover missing components of physics, it is likely we can make contact with intelligence outside of our earth. 

2. Assuming there is an objective truth, do you believe humans will be able to attain it? 
\n They're definitely trying. I don't believe human percpetion would be able to reach an objective truth however technology is an option to expand human perception and may reach an objective. But then again I don't believe there is any way to measure if a theory is actually an objective truth. '

Mike: The only truly objective truth I can think of would be a replicatable and proveable theory of everything, which would mathematically prove that the interactions of the universe are predetermined by mathematical certainty. The likelihood of us ever finding this truth, especially in our lifetimes, is essentially null, and the answer may even be beyond our human capacity for understanding. We may be able to one day develop an AI or other srtificial life form that can think beyond our own limitations, but the answers may only be understandable by beings of higher consciousness than we possess the ability to comprehend. TL;DR Probably not.

Fiona: Personal truth will always trump objective truth, as long as human thought is isolated from their environment. If we're talking on terms on communication beyond our basic outward physical queues & words/tone, we may be closer to a shared truth - but not a universal one.
